# nsvfbprofile

> This contains the updated source files for https://blog.angelengineering.com/resizing-images/ which describes how to extend a simple login Nativescript Vue app that uses Firebase Authentication (Email, Facebook and Google) and Font Awesome Icons, and works on both iOS and Android platforms. The app includes a tabbed application skeleton with a functional profile page, using Firebase Firestore and Storage, as well as some Nativescript plugins for images. This version adds automatic resizing of large images as well as a fix for Firebase initialization.


## Usage

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
tns build <platform> --bundle

# Build, watch for changes and run the application
tns run <platform> --bundle

```
